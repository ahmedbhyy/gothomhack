GuardianLock: Face Recognition Car Security üöóüë§ Enhance your car's security with GuardianLock, a Flutter app using advanced face recognition. Only authorized users can access the vehicle, offering an accessible user interface. üõ°Ô∏èüîê

## Camera Structure

The camera integrated into the smart car security system boasts cutting-edge features that center around driver identification through facial recognition. This component employs AI algorithms to analyze facial features for secure and accurate driver authentication. Enhanced by an ESP32 card, the camera establishes a real-time link to the car facilitating swift communication and data transfer. The focal point of this camera lies in its ability to make rapid decisions based on facial recognition results. Moreover, its synchronization with the mobile application enhances user control.

## Sensor System

In this innovative car security system, a sensor installed in the car door detects its opening, signaling the camera upon detection. Subsequently, the camera sends a notification to the vehicle owner. Following the notification, the camera enters a 5-second waiting period during which it actively scans for a facial recognition match. If no face is detected within this timeframe, an alarm is triggered for an additional 5 seconds. Should the camera still fail to identify a face during this second phase, a remote cutoff signal is initiated, implementing a secure measure to safeguard the vehicle.

# Mobile Application

In this mobile application, each user has a personalized profile containing information about their vehicles, authorized drivers, car details, and other features. The application is seamlessly connected to a camera. In the case of unauthorized facial recognition, the camera triggers a call to the owner's phone number and sends an alert through the app. The owner then has the option to permit the driver's access or activate a cutoff feature managed by the ESP32 microcontroller on the onboard system. Notably, the microcontroller includes a timer, so when a cutoff occurs, it has a predetermined duration, providing an added layer of control over the security measures implemented for the vehicle.
